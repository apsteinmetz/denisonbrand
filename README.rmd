## Overview

This package is intended to help the Denison University community create data visualizations using R code that is consistent with the Denison University Branding Guidelines. It provides color palettes, fonts, ggplot2 themes and graphic elements that are consistent with the guidelines. It also provides an html style sheet for use in Rmarkdown documents and Shiny apps.

This package is not a product of Denison University or sanctioned by the school. It is a personal project of the author, who is an alumnus. It is not intended to be a substitute for the official branding guidelines, but rather a tool to help people create R project visualizations that are consistent with the guidelines. The official branding guidelines are at [brand.,denison.edu](https://brand.denison.edu).

## Installation

First, install the package from GitHub (where you may also view the source code) using the `remotes` package. The package is not yet on CRAN.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("apsteinmetz/denisonbrand",build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Usage

Load the package and install the fonts.

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(denisonbrand)
load_fonts()
```

## Color Palettes

You have access to all the official Denison colors. The colors can be referred to in palette groups or by their individual names.

`den_palettes` a list of palettes
`den_colors` is a named vector of all the colors

You can view the palettes and colors by using the `color_bars()` function. 

```{r}
den_palettes
```

## The Fonts

Most of the official fonts are proprietary Adobe fonts and cannot be used in this open-source package.

`den_font_map` contains a table showing the official font names, the official sanctioned substitute fonts and the open source Google fonts that are used in this package. Several are the sanctioned substitutes and and some are the closest substitutes I could find.

```{r}
den_font_map

```

## ggplot2 Themes

The main purpose of this package is to support using `ggplot2` with Denison brand colors and typefaces.  `ggplot2` modifies plot elements through two primary paths, data elements such as lines, points and bars, and background elements such as axes, labels, legends, etc.  The `scale_*` functions are used to modify data elements, while the `theme_*` functions are used to modify background elements.  The `denisonbrand` package provides `ggplot2` functions for both of these and two somewhat non-standard meta functions to modify the data and background in one go.

The important ggplot2 functions are:

`scalel_color_den()` for setting colors of line and scatter plots.

`scale_fill_denison()` for setting colors of bars and other filled shapes.

`theme_den()` for setting background elements such as axes, labels, legends, etc. in accordance with Denison colors and typefaces. 

All of these work just like their ggplot2 equivalents, `scale_fill_manual()`,`scale_color_manual()` and `theme()`.  See the `ggplot2` documentation and the `denisonbrand` vignette for specific examples.

## An Example

First using `ggplot2` defaults.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)

gg <- rank_data |> 
  filter(college %in% peer_schools_list) |> 
  filter(year == 2024) |>
  mutate(college = fct_reorder(college, rank,.desc = TRUE)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(college,rank, fill = college)) +
  geom_col()  +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Denison's US News Ranking in 2024\nVs. Peers",
       subtitle = "(Lower Number is Better)",
       caption = "Source: US News and World Report",
       x = NULL,
       y = "Rank") +
  #remove legend
  theme(legend.position = "none")
print(gg)
```
Now with Dension colors and fonts.  The use of colors in this plot is kind of gratuitous and just to show the palette.
```{r}
gg <- gg + 
  scale_fill_den() +
  theme_den(legend.position = "none")
print(gg)
```
Additional details are in the vignette.

## Further Work

I am not aware of any brand standards for plots formatting.  Each department seems to do whatever it likes.  I'd like to see one standard, though.

The Vignette includes some CSS styling at the top but I'd like to learn how to make a proper CSS file and include it in the package.  

Also, I am thinking about the best way to provide easy access to logos for plot decorations.
